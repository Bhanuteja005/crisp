# ðŸŽ¬ Demo Video Script for Crisp Interview

## Video Duration: 3-4 minutes

### Opening (0:00 - 0:15)
**[Screen: Title slide with project logo]**

"Hi! Welcome to Crisp Interview - an AI-powered technical assessment platform that revolutionizes the interview process. Let me show you how this cutting-edge application works."

### Overview (0:15 - 0:30)
**[Screen: Application homepage showing both tabs]**

"Crisp Interview features two synchronized interfaces: an Interviewee tab for candidates taking the assessment, and an Interviewer tab for recruiters reviewing results. Everything is powered by Google's Gemini AI for intelligent question generation and scoring."

### Feature Demo - Interviewee Experience (0:30 - 1:45)

**[Screen: Interviewee tab - Resume upload]**
"Let's start with the candidate experience. First, they upload their resume - we support both PDF and DOCX formats."

**[Action: Drag and drop a sample resume]**
"The system automatically parses the resume using advanced text extraction, pulling out contact information like name, email, and phone number."

**[Screen: Show parsed fields with validation]**
"If any information is missing, the system prompts for manual entry with real-time validation."

**[Screen: Chat interface]**
"Once complete, candidates can start their interview. The AI generates 6 dynamic questions of varying difficulty - 2 easy, 2 medium, and 2 hard."

**[Action: Start interview and show first question]**
"Each question has a time limit - 20 seconds for easy, 60 for medium, and 2 minutes for hard questions. There's a visual timer with progress indication."

**[Action: Type an answer and submit]**
"Candidates can answer before time runs out, or the system auto-submits when time expires."

**[Screen: Show question progression]**
"The interface shows real-time progress and moves seamlessly between questions."

### AI Intelligence Demo (1:45 - 2:15)
**[Screen: Show AI scoring in action]**

"Behind the scenes, Gemini AI is working hard. It generates contextual questions based on the role, scores each answer on technical accuracy, communication clarity, and problem-solving approach, and provides detailed feedback."

**[Screen: Show sample AI feedback]**
"The AI provides constructive feedback for each response, helping candidates understand their performance."

### Interviewer Dashboard (2:15 - 2:45)
**[Screen: Switch to Interviewer tab]**

"Now let's see the recruiter experience. The dashboard shows all completed interviews with search and sorting capabilities."

**[Action: Search and sort candidates]**
"Recruiters can search by name, email, or score, and sort by various criteria."

**[Action: Click on a candidate]**
"Clicking on a candidate reveals their complete interview history - every question, answer, and AI score."

**[Action: Generate summary]**
"The AI can generate comprehensive summaries highlighting strengths and areas for improvement."

### Session Persistence Demo (2:45 - 3:00)
**[Screen: Show refresh/reload scenario]**

"One powerful feature is session persistence. If a candidate's browser crashes or they need to pause, they can resume exactly where they left off."

**[Action: Show welcome back modal]**
"The system detects unfinished interviews and offers seamless continuation."

### Technology & Closing (3:00 - 3:15)
**[Screen: Architecture overview]**

"Built with React, TypeScript, Redux for state management, and Tailwind for beautiful UI. All powered by Gemini AI for intelligent automation."

**[Screen: Final project view]**
"Crisp Interview demonstrates the future of technical assessments - intelligent, efficient, and user-friendly. Thank you for watching!"
