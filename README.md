# Core flows (pseudocode + implementation guidance)

## 1) Resume upload & field extraction

* Candidate uploads file in Interviewee tab.
* If PDF: use `pdf-parse` in browser (or send file to a small serverless function) to extract text.
* If DOCX: use `mammoth` to convert to text.
* Run regex patterns to extract **name, email, phone**:

  * Email: `/[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-z0-9.-]+\.[a-z]{2,}/i`
  * Phone: try `\+?\d{7,15}` with formatting cleanup.
  * Name: fallback â€” parse first lines or ask candidate to confirm name in chat.
* Save parsed fields to store. If any missing, mark `missingFields` and let chat ask them.

**Pseudocode**

```ts
const parsed = parseResume(file);
const { name, email, phone } = extractFields(parsed.text);
if (!name || !email || !phone) {
  // show missing fields flow in chat
}
```

## 2) Missing fields flow

* Before interview start, chat bot asks for any missing fields in natural sentences:

  * "I couldn't find a phone number on your resume. Could you share it now?"
* Candidate replies; validate & store before allowing the first question.

## 3) Interview question generation (AI)

* For production: call LLM to generate questions for role "Full Stack (React/Node)" with prescribed difficulties and one-by-one basis. Or pre-generate the 6 questions up-front.
* Recommendation: generate a question template set:

  * 2 easy (20s), 2 medium (60s), 2 hard (120s).
* For offline/dev: seed the questions array with static examples.

**Prompt example for LLM**

```
Generate one coding/interview question for a Full Stack (React/Node) role.
Difficulty: HARD
Output JSON: { "id": "...", "text": "...", "difficulty": "hard" }
```

## 4) Timers & auto-submit

* `Timer` component accepts seconds.
* When question displays, start countdown. If time hits 0:

  * auto-submit current text (even if empty) with `autoSubmitted=true`, record timestamp, move to next question.
* If candidate submits early, stop timer and move on.

Edge cases:

* If user refreshes or closes mid-question, the timer remaining must be persisted to store (save `questionStartedAt` and calculate remaining on restore).

**Timer persistence approach**

* Save `questionStartedAt` (timestamp) into candidate state.
* Remaining = `timerSeconds - (now - questionStartedAt)`. If <=0 then auto-submit on restore.

## 5) Scoring + final summary

* After each answer, send answer + question prompt to AI with an evaluation prompt that returns numeric score (0â€“100) and short feedback.
* After 6th question, compute final numeric score (weighted average or simple average) and request a short 2â€“4 sentence candidate summary from AI.

**Evaluation prompt idea**

```
You are an expert interviewer. Given the question and the candidate's answer, score 0-100 on technical correctness, brevity reasons, and provide a 1-2 sentence feedback. Output JSON { "score": 78, "feedback": "..." }
```

## 6) Interviewer dashboard

* Display candidates list (sortable by final score, date, progress).
* Clicking candidate opens details: full Q&A, per-question score+feedback, overall summary.
* Search by name/email; sort by score/date.

# State management & persistence

* Use **Redux Toolkit** with slices `candidates` and `ui`.
* Persist store with **redux-persist** and localStorage or use **localForage** for larger blobs.
* Persisted keys: candidates, current session progress, AI caches.
* On app load:

  * If thereâ€™s an unfinished candidate (`progress === 'in_progress'` and `currentQuestionIndex < 6`), show **Welcome Back** modal with Resume/Start options.
  * If clicked Resume â†’ restore timers & continue.
  * If Start New or Delete â†’ clear session.

# UI/UX wireframe (textual)

**Top nav**: Logo | Tabs: Interviewee | Interviewer

**Interviewee tab**

* Left: Resume upload + preview & parsed fields.
* Center: Chat window with messages (system/question as bot, candidate responses).
* Bottom: input box, submit button, small timer badge; progress progress bar (1/6).
* Modal for missing fields before first question.

**Interviewer tab**

* Top: Search input + sort dropdown.
* Body: Table of candidates (Name, Email, Score, Progress, Date).
* Right / modal: Candidate detail with timeline of Q&A + per-question score & final summary.
